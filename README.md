# TM-2022-Deep-reinforcement-learning

This repository contain the development code for my master thesis. It is split into multiple part:

- Introduction: It contain implementation of 2 already well known reinforcement learning problems (K-bandit and grid world). The grid world contain the implementation of a multitude of different agent (dynamic programming, Monte Carlo, TD and N-Step TD). Those agent are tested and presented into multiple test file that you can run if you want to try them yourself.

- Simple Implementation: This part contain a simulation environment to test agent against. The goal of this environment is to find Waldo (Were is Waldo?) in a minimum of time. It simulate the search in a high resolution image.

- Deeper Implementation: It is still a simulation environment but now deep reinforcement learning agent receive the state has an image.

- Real Implementation: Using the same problematic (Where is Waldo?) the agent is now in a real environment (a real high resolution image).
